# What's up ?

## What's *What's up ?*

*What's up ?* is an app that helps you log your daily activities. It is designed for a professionnal use but nothing prevents you to use it any other way.

## Why

Because it helps me a lot ! I don't know about you but my days are generally filled with different activities and most of the time I can barely remember 1 or 2 of those. The lead developer of my team, having the same recalling problem, had this idea of creating a really simple app to log our daily activities so here it is!

## Features

* Really simple way to log your activities
* Customisable reminders to help you log regularly
* A naturally sorted list of your activities to help find easily what you did yesterday or the day before
* Material design

## Download

You can find it on the [Android Playstore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dancing_koala.whathaveyoubeenupto)

## Technical details

* MVP architecture
* View Injection (Butterknife)
* RxJava Observables for background tasks
* Greendao for database management
* Not enough unit testing

## Criticize me

If you see something odd in the code, something that could be better, I'd love to know about it ! 
So don't hesitate to email me or even make a pull-request.
